A simple C++ program that reads through multiple text documents and builds appropriate
classes using the information provided.

The program emulates a system that keeps track of NHL statistics in separate classes
that include: the date, the player, the team, the stat, the stats and the league.

The focus on this work was on storing large quantities of information appropriate classes
using provided text files to do so. This also required rigorous usage of different string
operations and functioning flow of information between the classes. Of course, this also
includes proper encapsulation and hiding private information from prying eyes.
