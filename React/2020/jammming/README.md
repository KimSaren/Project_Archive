## The short description
An application based on the Spotify WEB API. It features a searchbar and two separate lists:
one for the search results and another for a customised playlist the user can build with the
songs in the database.

The application is done in a manner, that it directly references to the official Spotify WEB API
and get appropriate permissions by linking the user to an authorization prompt by Spotify.
This allows the application to not only view the Spotify song database, but also add new public playlists
of songs to the users Spotify account.
