# MyAnimeList Bingo (in progress)

This is a two-phase application. In the first phase, the user will fill their bingo sheet
using the JIKAN API-based searchbar on top of the page. In the second phase, the user will play
the bingo using said sheet. Shift between phases will be done with the buttons provided in the application.

This application is still heavily in-progress. To see a more detailed version of this application, please refer to
the original project found in the Javascript folder of this Project archive. The main purpose of this work
was for me to do an extensive project using ReactJS. Since I already had one for Javascript, it felt
appropriate to use the same work as a basis and try to solve the problems using component-based thinking.
