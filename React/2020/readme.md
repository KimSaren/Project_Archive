## Main projects

### mal_bingo
![Play mode](https://imgur.com/NUmG96O.png)
A bingo application I derived from my old work done purely with html/css/javascript. It's a pretty extensive one featuring interaction with an API, simple game mechanics and
pretty hefty logics for changing the state of the game at a given point. I did this from scratch, including the visuals. This application behaves nicely in mobile, except for datalist which is not supported in all mobile browsers.

### Jammming

A playlist saving application done in tandem with the Spotify WEB API. A pretty extensive project from codeacademy.

## Minor work

### Intro Project
An introductory project from reactjs.org. A simple tictoc application with some extra quality of life changes done for exercise.

### Calculator
A very simple calculator program. I wanted to try doing something simple with the components that would allow me to concretely see the result and
the state changes on the screen.
