A bingo generator and game utilising the JIKAN Web API. I used this work as a way to
get some extensive training on overall html/css/javascript techniques and designing 
responsive web applications in particular.

The visual representation of this work is still undergoing changes, but the functionalities
are there as I wanted them to be, for the most part.
