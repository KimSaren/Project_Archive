# MyAnimeList Bingo

A bingo generator and game utilising the JIKAN Web API. I used this work as a way to
get some extensive training on overall html/css/javascript techniques and designing 
responsive web applications in particular.

This application has two phases: the bingo sheet filling phase and the actual play phase. The user can swap between these
two modes with the buttons and navigations provided.

The visual representation of this work is still undergoing changes, but the functionalities
are there as I wanted them to be, for the most part.
